/**
 Class to efficiently keep track of the word count of an editable text view. As changes
 are made to the text in the configured text view, this class will calculate the total 
 word count of the text in the background, and then call on a @c BRWordCountDelegate
 instance with the results.
 
 This class works by setting it as the delegate of a @c UITextView. The only method
 this delegate actually uses is @c textView:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:
 however, so you can forward that method call to this object if you already have a
 delegate configured on a text view you'd also like to track the word count on.
